Simulation.slx: contains the Simulink

preproccesing_energy.m: is the matlab file to use the Simulink and inspect how the Simulink functions

Auto_preproccesing_energy: parallel simulates the Simulink file and tries to optimize a cost function to get an estimate for the amount of solar panels needed

Energy_season.m: Creates a representation of the ideal and or unideal energy generation from the solar panels in a day, depending on the season and variation state

Solar_generation_V2: Is a function that generates the energy generated by the solar panels for a day that can be done with the sunshine efficienty (variance factor) by adjusting the var_state to true or false
